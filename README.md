# timer

Apparently people still use this script. Surely there's something better now?

This was originally designed for jQuery 1.0 (yes, it's that old)
because I was using PrototypeJS (again, yes, old) and I wanted the functionality of Prototype's
[PerodicalExecutor](http://api.prototypejs.org/language/PeriodicalExecuter/).

It was orignally BSD licensed (3 clause), but now changed to MIT. 
In truth, I don't really care what you do with it.
